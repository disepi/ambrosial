Ambrosial is a launcher for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (specifically Windows 10 Edition) modifications. The source code is here for you to check for any malicious code, or if you're just curious.

## How it works
Ambrosial sends a download request to the server to download a encrypted JSON file (can be generated using the developer form) and then decrypts it and adds the modification's buttons and such to a windows form, then attaches events to the buttons. You can see how this works in more detail in the source code.

## Final notes
Ambrosial uses multiple NuGET packages, you may need to install these packages after downloading the source if you wish to build it. The list of required packages are below.
